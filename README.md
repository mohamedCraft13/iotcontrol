# iotcontrol
An all-in-one, 100% Python IoT ecosystem designed for simplicity and privacy.
iotcontrol removes the barriers to entry for IoT development. Built specifically for beginners and makers, it eliminates the complexity of low-level coding by providing a unified Python SDK that works across both your microcontrollers (via CircuitPython) and your Android application (via Kivy/paho-mqtt).
By handling the "heavy lifting" of communication, the SDK allows you to focus on building your project rather than troubleshooting MQTT protocols or managing socket connections.
